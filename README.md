# ✈️ Aircraft Tracking with YOLOv8

This project demonstrates an **aircraft detection and tracking** system built with **YOLOv8**, **Roboflow**, and **Google Colab**.  
The model detects airplanes in video frames and tracks them across time using **ByteTrack**, assigning a unique ID to each aircraft.

### 🧠 Project Goal
Developed as a **learning project** after completing a YOLO course — focused on understanding the full workflow:
- Preparing a dataset (from Pixabay aircraft videos)
- Labeling via Roboflow  
- Training YOLOv8 in Google Colab  
- Tracking with ByteTrack and saving the output video  

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** — Object Detection  
- **ByteTrack** — Object Tracking  
- **Roboflow** — Data Labeling  
- **Google Colab GPU** — Model Training  
- **OpenCV** — Visualization  
- **Pixabay** — Open video dataset source
